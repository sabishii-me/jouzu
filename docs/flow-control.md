# Flow control

Flow control coordinates background jobs, goals, loops, and tasks in one session. It is on by default.

- Background results arrive in batches after the current reply and any queued messages.
- Tasks can wait for your input or for another job before continuing.
- Ask Jouzu to show, reorder, pause, or continue tasks.

## Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/flow` | Show why automatic work stopped and how to resume it |
| `/flow pause` | Pause automatic replies. Background jobs keep running. |
| `/flow resume` | Allow automatic replies again |
| `/flow off` | Turn flow control off for this session. Messages run as ordinary turns; jobs, tasks, and loops send their own notifications. |
| `/flow on` | Turn flow control back on |
| `/flow reset` | Turn flow control off and on again, resetting queued and held delivery |
| `/flow clear` | Release a stuck turn. Run while Jouzu is idle. |
| `/flow resolve <attempt> retry` or `discard` | Settle a model request with an unknown outcome, using the attempt ID shown by `/flow` |
| `/flow runtime` | Show startup package paths and hashes |

- Interrupting a reply also pauses automatic work until your next message or `/flow resume`.
- `off`, `on`, `reset`, and `clear` keep the session, its records, and running jobs.
- `retry` may repeat a request the model already answered.
- Set `JOUZU_FLOW_CONTROL=0` before starting Jouzu to disable flow control for that process.

## Waiting for jobs

When an `agent_wait` call returns `waiting`, completion, failure, or deadline expiry schedules a response at the next eligible turn. If a reply is in progress, Flow waits for it to finish. Queued user messages run first and can carry the wait outcome in their context. Successful delivery does not schedule the same outcome again.

An explicit pause or an unresolved execution outcome still blocks automatic replies. The wait outcome stays pending; use `/flow` to inspect the blocker.

Inputs that can no longer be delivered remain visible as undelivered input, but are not queued and do not block automatic replies. Submit one again only if it is still needed. If dispatch was interrupted and its outcome is unknown, inspect the session and job state before using `/flow clear`. Clearing releases that recovery hold without replaying the interrupted input.

## Branches and resuming

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Return to where you left a recent branch | Its unfinished work resumes, including tasks waiting for background jobs |
| Rewind to an earlier point | Starts a new branch; unfinished work does not resume. File changes are not undone. |
| Reopen a session | Continues from its last saved position, which may differ from the branch you last viewed |

## Missing tool results

- If a branch lacks a tool result, Jouzu tells the model the outcome is unknown. It does not rerun the tool, copy a result from another branch, or edit the saved conversation.
- If Jouzu cannot match tool calls to their results, it stops the request.
