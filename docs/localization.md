# Localization and residual English

Jouzu offers English and a Japanese preview for its own interface. This does not
mean that every screen in a session is translated or that Japanese is qualified
on every operating system, terminal, input method, or screen reader.

The source tree also contains Simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`) and Traditional
Chinese (`zh-Hant`) draft catalogs. They are not offered as interface languages.
A request for either uses the English catalog. Response-language preferences
are separate and accept all four language tags; they instruct the model and do
not establish the quality of its output.

## Choose a language

When no preference is saved, select a startup language with:

```bash
jz --jouzu-ui-locale ja
jz --jouzu-ui-locale en
```

`JOUZU_UI_LOCALE` is the environment-variable alternative. A preference confirmed
in Settings overrides both launch inputs; saved `auto` follows the OS locale.
[Language, locale and prompt instructions](language.md) explains identity, profiles,
UI/response/artifact preferences, persistence and child inheritance in one place.
See [Configuration](configuration.md#language) for the saved `localization.json`
shape. The UI locale, response language, and artifact
policy are separate settings; changing the UI locale does not translate source
code, commands, identifiers, or existing artifacts.

The first-run prompt offers `English` and `日本語`, then asks for a response
language separately. Chinese self-names appear as unavailable interface choices.
The [Settings Language controls](palette-ux.md#settings) preview choices without
writing them. Confirmation saves the choice and refreshes supported screens.

## Translation boundaries

| Surface | Boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Jouzu catalog-backed labels and messages | Render from the English or Japanese catalog. Missing messages use English fallback. |
| Jouzu browser adapter | Tool labels use the Jouzu catalog; `tff-fetch_url` and `tff-search_web` remain unchanged. |
| Pi built-in settings, theme, thinking, trust, login, resume, tree and fork selectors | Jouzu translates their owned labels while preserving user text and restoring native state after rendering. Very narrow layouts can retain truncated native labels. |
| Third-party extensions | Own their content; Jouzu does not translate arbitrary extension labels or output. |
| Shisa account dashboard and sign-in | Open service-owned browser pages. Their language is controlled by the service. |
| Commands, tool names, model IDs, paths, URLs, and diagnostic identifiers | Stay unchanged; see the [catalog glossary](localization-glossary.md). |
| Model responses, tool output, and source errors | Are not UI translations. The response-language setting guides model explanations; quoted source text remains intact. |

Billing is handled by the Shisa service. Jouzu links to the account dashboard
and sign-in page; it has no CLI billing screen. See [Shisa AI account](shisa.md).

## Catalog support states

`jz doctor` reports catalog metadata, not a whole-product readiness judgment.
The state names are machine identifiers and remain in English.

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `complete` | The catalog is offered, its metadata marks it reviewed, its recorded source digest matches, and no source message is missing. |
| `partial` | The catalog is offered but misses a message carried by the English source. |
| `stale` | The recorded source digest differs from the English source digest. |
| `fallback` | The requested catalog was not used; this run uses English instead. |
| `unsupported` | The catalog is not offered, lacks the required metadata, or cannot be used. |

`packages/cli/locales/catalog-status.json` supplies the recorded source version,
source digest, and review flag. These fields describe catalog bookkeeping; even
`complete` does not certify translation quality, upstream coverage, or native
terminal behavior. The Chinese drafts are not offered regardless of their
message counts.

## Check your installation

```bash
jz doctor
jz doctor --json
```

The JSON report contains a `fields` array. Each entry has an `id`, `section`,
`label`, and `value`; a dotted ID is not a nested JSON property.

| Field ID | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `localization.requested` | The resolved UI preference, including `auto`. |
| `localization.effective` | The locale selected by settings and environment resolution, before catalog fallback. |
| `localization.source` | The source that supplied that locale. |
| `localization.fallback` | A settings or locale-resolution fallback reason, when present. |
| `localization.catalogVersion` | The loaded catalog's version. |
| `localization.catalogDigest` | The loaded catalog's digest. |
| `localization.catalogFallback` | A catalog-loading fallback reason, when present. |
| `localization.catalogState` | The loaded catalog's support state, or `fallback`. |
| `localization.supportStates` | The per-catalog support states. |

The requested locale and the loaded catalog can differ. For example, a Chinese
locale request can retain its tag in `localization.effective` while
`localization.catalogState` is `fallback` and the digest belongs to English.

The report also summarizes a recorded set of display surfaces under
`upstream.*` field IDs. Those counts describe the record, not a percentage of
translated strings or proof that every surface was checked against the installed
Pi version. Version changes require the checks in
[Pi update review](PI-UPDATES.md#localization-re-inspection).

`jz doctor` reads local data without a network check. For rendering and manual
terminal procedures, see [CJK verification](localization-cjk-verification.md).
