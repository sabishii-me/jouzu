# Built-in tools

The `core` and `ja` profiles load the same tools.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `schedule_prompt` | One-time and recurring prompts |
| `bg_task` | Run and monitor shell processes without blocking |
| `web_fetch`, `batch_web_fetch` | Fetch readable HTTP content. See [Web tools](web.md). |
| `tff-fetch_url`, `tff-search_web` | Browser-rendered fetch and search. See [Web tools](web.md). |
| `TaskCreate` and related task tools | Track finite work |
| `get_goal`, `update_goal` | Work toward a goal you set with `/goal` |
| `multiloop_*` | Record approved measured-improvement loops |
| `subagent` | Run child agents. See [Agents and runs](subagents.md). |
| `vcc_recall` | Search earlier session history, including compacted entries |
| `compact_context` | Request compaction after the current run settles |

Also included:

- Code previews for supported tool calls and results. Syntax colors follow Pi's light or dark theme when a session starts. To choose a fixed Shiki theme, set `CODE_PREVIEW_THEME` (for example `CODE_PREVIEW_THEME=github-light`) or pick one in `/code-preview-settings`.
- Skill suggestions when you type `$` at the start of a word.

## MCP servers

Jouzu connects to Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to use their tools and resources. Put user-level servers in `mcp.json` inside your [agent/config directory](../README.md#state-and-isolation), or project servers in `.pi/mcp.json`.

Project configuration is read only after you trust the project. Keep credentials and personal servers in the user-level file.

For example, configure a streamable HTTP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs": {
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer ${DOCS_TOKEN}" },
      "description": "Search the team's documentation"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace the URL with your server and set `DOCS_TOKEN` in the environment.

Local servers use `command`, `args`, and optional `env` instead of `url` and `headers`. They run with your user permissions, so review their configuration before connecting.

Use `/mcp` to inspect connections, sign in, reconnect, or enable and disable servers. Run `/reload` after editing the configuration outside the session.

MCP tool results and resources pass through [TextGuard](textguard.md) by default. The default (`/textguard on`) mode annotates flagged visible content and omits structured metadata; strict mode withholds flagged results until approval.

By default, server tools are **deferred**: the assistant uses `tool_search` to find them, then calls the matched tools directly.

Set `exposure` to `direct` to declare a server's tools immediately, or `hidden` to make them unreachable. `toolExposure` overrides this per tool. Jouzu also maps saved `codemode` exposure to `deferred` without rewriting your configuration.

## Goals and loops

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/goal` | List running and paused goals with command hints |
| `/goal pause [lane/run-tag]` | Pause a goal |
| `/goal stop [lane/run-tag]` | Stop a goal |
| `/goal resume [lane/run-tag]` | Resume a goal |
| `/multiloop` | Show all loops |

- Without a target, pause and stop act on the attached goal, or the only matching one.
- Resume picks the only saved goal directly. With more than one goal, the agent uses the conversation and saved goals to find the one you mean.
- Resume prompts the agent immediately when idle, or queues the request while it works.
- The Session Line shows running, paused, stopped, and completed counts for goals and loops in the session.

## Compaction

[pi-vcc](https://github.com/sting8k/pi-vcc), based on [VCC](https://github.com/lllyasviel/VCC), compacts the conversation without a model call when it nears or exceeds the context window.

- Compaction shortens the active transcript. Running work continues.
- `vcc_recall` retrieves details from the current session, including entries removed from the active transcript. It cannot start compaction.
- `compact_context` lets the assistant request compaction explicitly. Compaction waits until the current run settles and queued messages have been handled. After successful compaction, the agent continues; a failure reports the problem without automatically continuing.

## Bundled and added packages

- Bundled tools and their dependencies ship inside the `jouzu` package. A normal launch installs nothing from npm or Git.
- Exception: the browser client installs on first use. See [Web tools](web.md#browser-runtime).
- Packages you add yourself are separate, user-managed state. Jouzu release testing does not cover them, and they run with your user permissions.
